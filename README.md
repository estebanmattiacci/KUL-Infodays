***REMOVED*** KU Leuven Information Days Website

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Project Overview

This project is developed as part of a school assignment (_grade obtained: 15/20_) and is designed to provide a comprehensive website for KU Leuven Information Days. 
The main goal of the website is to offer a platform where students can register for upcoming information days and leave feedback about their experiences, thereby 
 improving organization and effectiveness of the information days, bridging the gap between students and the university.
